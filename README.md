# XResume
XML + XSD + XSLT Resume Standards

## Why XML?
> If I were to create a Resume to put online, it would be much easier to write a HTML page.

Why do you need a resume?

- Printing and handling them on fancy leather covers? Use Microsoft Word.
- Becoming more visible for recruiters having an online resume? Sign up for LinkedIn.
- Showing off your skills building your own page with responsive CSS and jumpscare javaScript? Go for it.
- Becoming part of a database, so potential employers can find my profile whithout much effort?

Using XML it's possible to treat documents as databases or database entries.
While it is possible to do that with HTML, XML has a better mechanism for querying.
The whole purpose of writing a resume is, if not being directly visited in your profile, bein found.

Other benefits of XML are related to the other tools like XSD and XSLT.
Being capable of a full featured database solution also support definition of Schemas which allow standardisation.

## Why XSD?
> Why bother making a strict schema?

## Why XSLT?
> Why not just CSS?
